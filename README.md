# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

In this project I was creating a weather dashboard that provided weather outlook for multiple cities

## Tasks Completed

I created a search function that displayed current weather temperature, wind speed, and humidity in a user searched city. I was able to console log a 5 day forecast with each city search but was unable to display it on page.
